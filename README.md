# reimagined-tribble
Based on project from [Mastering Qt 5](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-qt-5).

All the good stuff is based on the documentation in the book. All the errors and strangeness is caused my me. Probably.

## Chapter One
This creates a todo style application, the files are in the `Todo` folder.

## Chapter Two
This introduces multiplatform development.

`ch02-sysinfo` is likely to create a tool to get information from the computer used.
As I use both Linux and Windows 10, this gives me two of the main platforms to work with. I should be able to get my hands an OSX device also, so lots of opportunities for multiplatform development and testing.
